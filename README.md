Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was a video game designer that was looking the design a browser based game application for cross platform use. They needed a back end server and client security authorizations.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel that I developed the recommendations for platform development particularly well and that the comparisons between the operating systems where in depth.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

the design document helped me understand what the code ultimately needs to do, and helped me avoid going in a direction that would be less than ideal. It helped me stay on track and understand the purpose of the code being developed.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel that I did not fully understand the design constraints as I was writing that part of the documentation. I would look further into the specific type of application if I were to write a document like this in the future. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


I decided that the user needed certain hardware for use on the backend communications as well as security considerations. It is important to keep this in mind so that the customer is satisfied with the end result.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I went for a top down approach. first looking at the entire design and deciding constraints, then looking at the needs of individual components.
